bones. Due to their spread around the
globe they're know by many names such
as: Sheltering Land Squid, Landsquid,
Skeleton Puppetier, Obtiuary Octopus,
Bone Collector Squid, Grave Robber
Squid and many others.
Many of the names given to this
squid derive from their behavior of
using bones as a form of protection.
These animals can be easily found
around cemeteries, monster lairs and
dungeons, they can also be (found less
frequently) around swamps, caves,
rivers and lakes.
They are the only species of
cephalopods to be able to survive on
land. They do occasionally go to water
to re-hydrate their sensitive skin and
bread. Hermit Squids still retain the
ability to breath underwater, even
though it's rare to see them do so.
